Chap 2: Introducing Functional Programming
------------------------------------------

The Java compiler implicitly assumes that any interface that contains exactly
one abstract method is a functional interface.

General Interfaces Notes
------------------------

1) If an interface inherits same static methods from two or more different parents, it's not an issue.
static is related to class level.

Father: static void sMeth()
Mother: static void sMeth()
Child ext Father and Mother.

2) If an interface inherits same abstract methods from two or more different parents, it's not an issue.

Father: void meth()
Mother: void meth()
Child ext Father and Mother.

3) If an interface inherits same default methods from two or more different parents.

You MUST override in the child.

Father: default void deMeth()
Mother: default void deMeth()
Child ext Father and Mother: void deMeth()

4) Mixed case, Child MUST override the default/abstract method

Father: default void deMeth()
Mother: static void deMeth()
Child ext Father and Mother: void deMeth()
